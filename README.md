# PortfolioWebsite

A demo project to showcase my web development skills and highlight some of my work.  
**Please note, this is not my official portfolio.**

## Overview

This is my very first beginner-level web project, built to get hands-on experience with the fundamentals of web development: structuring content with HTML, styling with CSS and adding interactivity with JavaScript.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Leg3ndEntity/PortfolioWebsite.git
   ```
2. **Open** `index.html` in your browser.  

## Next Steps & Ideas

- **Interactive 3D models**: showcasing my 3D creations  
- **University projects**: academic assignments and group work
- **Contact form integration**: to collect messages.  

## Experiences Section

I decided to keep the full “Experiences” text embedded directly in `index.html` rather than loading it from a separate file for the following reasons:

- **Offline accessibility**: anyone who clones or downloads the repository can immediately read all content without needing to run a local server or fetch external files.  
- **Simplified setup**: embedding the text avoids extra HTTP requests and external dependencies, so the project works out-of-the-box by simply opening `index.html`.
