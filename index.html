# Experiences

## Apple Developer Academy – Pier Program
        
**July 2024 – June 2025**
        
As the designated coder, I was responsible not only for the technical development of iOS applications using Swift and SwiftUI, but also for:
        
* Writing clear, maintainable code and documenting all modules.
* Implementing and executing unit/UI tests to ensure functionality and reliability.
* Collaborating in a professional Agile environment, following Scrum methodology.
* Participating in code reviews and continuous integration workflows.
        
**Field Testing in Johannesburg**
Through the Pier Program’s collaboration with iSchoolAfrica—a non-profit dedicated to expanding access to quality education in rural African schools—I traveled with my team to Johannesburg to test the product on the ground with its intended users.
        
        
## European Heritage Network on Tour – Erasmus+
        
**November 2019 – December 2019**
        
I took part in a month-long Erasmus+ program in Lisbon organized by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, an international institution committed to art, culture, and education. During this program, I:
        
* Completed 60 hours of training delivered by specialists in cultural heritage, arts, history, science, and citizenship values.
* Engaged in guided visits to key heritage sites across Portugal.
* Collaborated on group projects focusing on digital tools for heritage promotion.
